            <p><span className="About--emphasize">I'm an engineer with a strong focus on communication and product building.</span>  Other than dev work, I have experience in professional Project Management and Consulting (2.5 years) and Product Management/Quality Assurance Testing (1.5 years). Now, I'm pursuing my dream of becoming an engineer — who I believe are the lifeblood of tech companies. My current engineering skillset includes <span className="About--emphasize">React, NodeJS, ExpressJS, PostgreSQL, C++, Javascript, CSS, and Python!</span></p>
            <p>I've worked with both start ups and international companies (based in the US, Thailand, and Singapore). I'm not just an engineer that works fast — I can also work independently in complex environments thanks to my <span className="About--emphasize">stakeholder management skills</span> and experience in <span className="About--emphasize">end-to-end product development and testing.</span> </p>
            <p>Outside of work, I am obsessed with <span className="About--emphasize">volleyball</span> and my own little area of nerd culture (<span className="About--emphasize">dungeons and dragons, anime, improv, and stand up comedy</span>). I also like writing (<span className="About--emphasize">read my blogs here</span>).</p>
            <p>My top recommendations: D&D Show (<span className="About--emphasize">Fantasy High Season 1 by Dimension 20</span>), anime (<span className="About--emphasize">Diamond no Ace,  Haikyuu, and HxH</span>), improv (<span className="About--emphasize">Game Changer/Make Some Noise by Dropout</span>), stand up comedy (<span className="About--emphasize">X by Daniel Sloss</span>).</p>
